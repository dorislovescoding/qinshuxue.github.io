## Working Papers

**[Demand Risk,Upstream Market Power and Sourcing Decisions in the US Automobile Industry](http://qinshuxue/files/jmp.pdf)** 
> This paper studies how demand uncertainty and upstream market structure would affect downstream sourcing decisions. I focus on the US automobile industry and its transmission suppliers. When the downstream can also produce the input and the demand is uncertain, their outsourcing decision can affect upstream market structure and the amount of risk taken by them. In the project, I ask to what extent outsourcing decisions are driven by such risk consideration and how upstream market structure would affect it. Using demand shocks from the BLP model as demand uncertainty estimates, I first find the reduced form relation that when upstream's market power is large, the downstream firms reduce their outsourcing when facing increasing demand volatility. I additionally build a model to reflect such changes where the key driving force is an uncertain internal input cost versus a stable input price charged by upstream. By estimating a model based on the US automobile industry's data, I find that upstream indeed serves as insurance for downstream in economic downturns. However, the effect is greatly reduced when the upstream becomes more concentrated. These findings emphasize the interdependence between market structure and vertical relations. Policies aimed at protecting the local economy should also consider its impact along the vertical chain.

**[Productivity and Exporting Behavior in the Chinese Footwear Industry.](http://qinshuxue/files/footwear.pdf)**  
>This paper studies whether in the footwear industry in China exporters are of higher measured productivity than non-exporters and whether trade liberalization will lead to within firm productivity increase. Since I don't observe physical output data at firm level, I construct a demand system with the production function to deliver valid physical productivity estimates following De Loecker (2011). After purging out the price effect, exporters have higher physical productivity than non-exporters in the footwear industry. While the aggregate productivity fluctuates during the sample period, as the tariff protection decrease, there are significant within firm productivity gains. In addition, I find pure processing trade firms, which imported duty-free intermediate input from abroad but are forced to reexport all its final product, have substantially lower productivity than other exporters and also have lower productivity gains from trade liberalization.
