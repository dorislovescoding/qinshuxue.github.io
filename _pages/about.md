I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics, Cornell University.

My research interests are Empirical Industrial Organization, Firm Dynamics and Trade. In my job market paper, I study the vertical relationship in the automobile industry and the role of demand risk in shaping firms boundaries.
